The construction industry represents a significant portion of the global economy, accounting for 9% of the global GDP. Recent trends to mitigate the sector's inherent inefficiencies have seen a shift towards leveraging advanced analytical tools. Over the past decade, considerable research has focused on technological advancements such as web-based collaborative tools, emphasizing aspects like interoperability, workflow management, and technological boundaries. However, a largely unexplored area remains the direct assessment of client satisfaction through analytical means. Currently, with over 5,300,000 users employing web-based collaborative tools in construction, there is a burgeoning need to harness these digital interactions to gauge client sentiment effectively.

This research proposes the use of sentiment analysis to evaluate client satisfaction, aiming to transform qualitative feedback into actionable data to enhance service delivery in construction projects. By analyzing sentiment data extracted from online communications and feedback mechanisms, this study seeks to provide a deeper understanding of client expectations and satisfaction levels. This approach not only promises to refine client-service provider interactions but also aims to drive improvements in project outcomes by aligning services more closely with client needs. As the industry progresses, incorporating the nuanced perspectives of clients through sentiment analysis will be crucial for the continuous enhancement of web-based collaborative platforms and overall project success.
