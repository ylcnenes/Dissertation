# Dissertation

This repository has been developed as part of a thesis for a Master's Degree in Data Analysis. Originating from a background in Civil Engineering, my objective is to intertwine my academic roots with my current studies. Through this research, I aim to draw meaningful insights that bridge both fields of Data Analysis and Civil Engineering, adhering to robust methodologies. This endeavor is not just a fulfillment of academic requirements; it's a synthesis of my educational journey, aiming to contribute valuable perspectives to both disciplines. The ultimate goal is to showcase how data-driven approaches can innovate and solve complex problems in Civil Engineering, setting new benchmarks for industry practices. I would also like to extend my gratitude to my mentor, David Gonzalez, for his anticipated support and guidance on my thesis.
